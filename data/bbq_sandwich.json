    "Preheat oven to 350Â°F.",
    "Prepare tofu by pressing out the water (one good strategy is to freeze in package, thaw in fridge, and then press. This will give it a better texture).",
    "Cover tofu with BBQ Sauce and place on lined baking sheet.",
    "Place in oven for 45 minutes, check regularly and add brush on more sauce as it dries.",
    "Remove from oven and assemble sandwich.",
